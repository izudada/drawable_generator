Python tools I can use is:

- [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
- [OpenCV](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/)

Currently reading Pillow docs, to see how this canbe possible.


#   Implementation
I wrote a simple python script to resize an image using Pillow. 
Carbon link for the script [here](https://carbon.now.sh/oIJltPbBdNm3RGDpOa45)

Django will make building this project easier. SO I am going to be tapping into its framework.
