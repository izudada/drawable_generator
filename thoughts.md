I went through an [Udacity Android Basics Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-nanodegree-by-google--nd803) and it was a wonderful experience building projects for android platform.

My experience building a [our Guide App](https://github.com/izudada/tour_guide) was an eye openner to using fragments. My core pain points was trying to resize multiple images. A tool I used only allowed resizing for one image at a time. 

All I needed was a tool that will allow me resize multiple images at once.

Thus the advent of this project.

Python tools I can use is:

- [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
- [OpenCV](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/)

Currently reading Pillow docs, to see how this canbe possible.


#   Implementation
I wrote a simple python script to resize an image using Pillow.
